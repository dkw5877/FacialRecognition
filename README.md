FacialRecognition

This end gaol of this app is to use Apple's built-in face detection feature to find facces in a image and implement facial recognition on the face to extract the features. The goal will be to implement an Eigenfaces algorithm to compare extracted faces to source face.

Currently the app will find faces in a image and highlight the face. The app also allows the user to apply several different fiters to the image and implements feature chaining to apply the filter in the order in which they were selected by the user.
